## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** (with Docker Compose v1 or v2)
- **4GB+ RAM** available for containers  
- **Modern web browser** (Chrome/Chromium recommended)
- **Optional**: NVIDIA GPU with drivers for AI/ML acceleration

### One-Command Installation

```bash
# Clone and deploy in one go
git clone <repository-url>
cd XaresAICoder
./deploy.sh
```

**That's it!** The deploy script automatically:
- ‚úÖ Detects Docker Compose version (v1 or v2)
- ‚úÖ Sets up persistent Docker network  
- ‚úÖ Builds custom VS Code image with AI tools
- ‚úÖ Configures environment settings
- ‚úÖ Deploys and health-checks the application

### Access Your Platform

After deployment completes, open your browser to:
- **Default**: http://localhost
- **Custom domain**: Your configured domain from the deploy script

### Create Your First Project

#### From Template
1. Enter a project name
2. Select your preferred project type:
   - **Empty Project**: Clean slate with just README and git initialization
   - **Python Flask**: Full-stack web applications with Flask framework
   - **Node.js React**: Modern web applications with React 18 and Vite
   - **Java Spring Boot**: Enterprise applications with Spring Boot 3.1
3. Choose memory allocation (1GB, 2GB default, 4GB, 8GB, or 16GB RAM) and CPU cores (1-8)
4. **Optional**: Check "Password Protect Workspace" for secure access
5. **Optional**: Check "Create Git Repository" to automatically set up Git
6. Click "Create Workspace"

#### From Git Repository
1. Enter a project name
2. Check "**Clone from Git Repository**"
3. Enter the **Git Repository URL** (e.g., `https://github.com/user/repo.git`)
4. For **private repositories**:
   - Enter your **Git Username** (GitHub/GitLab username)
   - Enter your **Access Token** (GitHub Personal Access Token, GitLab token, etc.)
5. Choose memory allocation and CPU cores as needed
6. **Optional**: Check "Password Protect Workspace" for secure access
7. Click "Create Workspace"

**‚úÖ Result**: VS Code opens with your repository files ready to edit, and all Git operations (push, pull, etc.) work seamlessly!

**üí° GPU Support**: If your host system has NVIDIA GPUs, they are automatically available in all workspaces for ML/AI development. Test with:
```bash
# Check GPU availability in workspace terminal
ls -la /dev/nvidia*
nvidia-smi  # if NVIDIA drivers are installed
```

### AI Tools Setup

Once in your workspace, run these commands to get started:
```bash
info                  # Show workspace info, AI tools, and current Git status
setup_ai_tools        # Detailed setup instructions for all AI tools
update_ai_agents      # Update AI tools to latest versions
```

docker compose restart     # or docker-compose restart

# Update deployment
git pull && ./deploy.sh --skip-network
```

## üåê Port Forwarding & Application Access

XaresAICoder uses **subdomain-based routing** for seamless application access:

- **React/Node.js**: `http://projectid-3000.localhost/`  
- **Spring Boot**: `http://projectid-8080.localhost/`

VS Code automatically detects ports and provides one-click browser access.

## üîê Security

- **Optional Password Protection**: Secure individual workspaces with passwords
- **Container Isolation**: Each workspace runs in isolated Docker containers
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits prevent resource exhaustion
- **Network Isolation**: Workspaces can't access each other
